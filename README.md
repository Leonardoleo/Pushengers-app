*Add on new features soon. Stay Tuned!

New Features:

-Allow you to search by pressing “Enter” (or “Return”) on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking

-Implement your own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location)

-Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click “Let’s Go” again

-Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab

-Make images clickable and have them open the business’ website in a new tab
